		<br><p style="color: white">.I am Kali J.S. Oden I live in atlanta,georgia. I was born in 2003 on  november 6 at 11:40 a.m or p.m day, To my parents Damon Oden and Brandy Graham, In Northside Hospital. I've lived from decataur to camp creek and that I've been paintballing and let me just say if you don't like pain don't do it , and that I have two brothers one is 23 and born on december 23 or 24 I don't really remember and my baby brother who is going on 5 in october 26.<br>                                        

		<br>I have 4 bestfriends because ,I am a special breed and I am very "active"  and they are my devils and angels in their on sense that they give me pro's and con's, and  something slight is  that my favorite colours, are black,blue and red which I guess is why I've  worn red the first week of "S.M.A.S.H" entire week on accident.And that I have fallen asleep in every class for the first few days but know I haven't in some time now.I am enjoying S.M.A.S.H very much because it challenges me to do better but I'm starting to think that some of the  R.A.'s don't really like me much but at this point I'm not surprised because some of them had to come to our room to resolve some "issues" because we require some guidence but however annoyed they don't mind helping out.  I had a turtle that my mom killed on accident of course and I am apart of a few clubs like F.B.L.A,Latin club,J.R.O.T.C, and now N.S.H.S.S. Honors <br></p>
